## üå©Ô∏è Physical Principles Behind Volumetric Cloud Rendering

This project implements physically-inspired volumetric cloud rendering using raymarching techniques in a real-time graphics context. The following physical principles and equations are foundational to its implementation:

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Participating Media and Radiative Transfer

Clouds are modeled as **participating media**‚Äîvolumes composed of small water droplets or ice particles that absorb and scatter light. Light interaction in such media is described by the **Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE)**:

$$
\frac{dL(\mathbf{x}, \omega)}{ds} = -\sigma_t(\mathbf{x}) L(\mathbf{x}, \omega) + \sigma_s(\mathbf{x}) \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} p(\omega', \omega) L(\mathbf{x}, \omega') \, d\omega' + Q(\mathbf{x}, \omega)
$$

* $L(\mathbf{x}, \omega)$: Radiance at point $\mathbf{x}$ in direction $\omega$
* $\sigma_t = \sigma_s + \sigma_a$: Extinction coefficient (sum of scattering and absorption)
* $p(\omega', \omega)$: Phase function (probability of scattering from direction $\omega'$ to $\omega$)
* $Q$: Emission term (ignored for non-luminous clouds)

In this project, the implementation assumes **single scattering** and ignores in-scattering from other directions to maintain real-time performance.

### üí° Beer-Lambert Law for Light Absorption

The attenuation of light along a ray through a medium is computed using the **Beer-Lambert law**:

$$
T(d) = \exp\left(-\int_0^d \sigma_t(s) \, ds\right)
$$

In practice, this is approximated by accumulating the extinction term during raymarching steps.

---

### üå´Ô∏è Raymarching Accumulation

For each ray traced from the camera into the volume, a fixed number of samples is taken using **raymarching**. At each step $i$:

$$
L_{\text{acc}} += T_i \cdot \sigma_s(i) \cdot p(\omega_l, \omega_v) \cdot L_{\text{light}} \cdot \Delta s
$$

Where:

* $T_i$: Transmittance from the ray origin to step $i$
* $\omega_l$: Light direction
* $\omega_v$: View direction
* $p$: Phase function
* $\Delta s$: Step length

This accumulation approximates the scattered light contribution along the ray.

### üåà Henyey-Greenstein Phase Function

The **Henyey-Greenstein phase function** is often used to approximate anisotropic scattering in clouds:

$$
p(\cos\theta) = \frac{1 - g^2}{4\pi (1 + g^2 - 2g\cos\theta)^{3/2}}
$$

* $\theta$: Angle between incoming and outgoing directions
* $g$: Anisotropy parameter, where $g > 0$ favors forward scattering (typical for clouds: $g \approx 0.8$)

---

### üîä Density Field and Procedural Noise

Cloud density is procedurally defined using 3D fractal noise functions, such as **Perlin noise** or **FBM (Fractal Brownian Motion)**:

$$
\rho(\mathbf{x}) = \text{FBM}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \text{heightFalloff}(y)
$$

This gives a realistic, dynamic structure to the cloud volume.
